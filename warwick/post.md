- Goals: 
What the focus, do you want the user find something they personally can relate to it, or do you want to tell them what you have found and why it is worthwhile to be understood?

0. Talk to people:

If there is a significance in the data, the chance that experts already know this is high. Talk to people in the field, listen to ever aspect of their pain points.

Investigative data reporting: CORRECT!V

First German data driven newsroom?
CORRECT!V crowdfunds data!

The process for investigative data journalism Schraven’s organisation follows includes three major steps.

“First of all we try to find out how to create a visualisation from it. We try to find a story in the big data sets, the key points, and what is important about all this data. 

"Once we found the story, we try to find human beings who can talk about it and who have been affected by the issue we found,” he explained.

1. Find the data:

Data portals

Open Data Courses

Collaborate with organisations

Be curious but suspicious if data is being offered 
(chance it only shows "good stuff" is heigh)

Don't be afraid of larger data sets
(One way to get around is to query big data. Learn using SQL, ...
or Apache Drill
https://drill.apache.org/

"There's no need to load the data, create and maintain schemas, or transform the data before it can be processed. Instead, simply include the path to a Hadoop directory, MongoDB collection or S3 bucket in the SQL query."

Data scraping
Do it the easy way: 
Kimono
ScraperWiki

or the hard way: 
Look into the source code, or write scripts

Personal data: 
Devices, trackers, IOT
